# üöÄ Pitchfork Protocol Web3 Testing Guide

## Overview
This guide will help you test the complete Web3 integration of Pitchfork Protocol, including MetaMask wallet connection, smart contracts, and decentralized features.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Install MetaMask
- Download MetaMask browser extension: https://metamask.io/
- Create a new wallet or import existing one
- **IMPORTANT**: Use testnet for testing (Sepolia, Goerli, or local network)

### 2. Get Test ETH
- For Sepolia testnet: https://sepoliafaucet.com/
- For Goerli testnet: https://goerlifaucet.com/
- For local development: Use Hardhat/Ganache local blockchain

### 3. Network Configuration
Add these networks to MetaMask if testing on testnets:

**Sepolia Testnet:**
- Network Name: Sepolia
- RPC URL: https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_KEY
- Chain ID: 11155111
- Currency Symbol: ETH

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Phase 1: Wallet Connection
- [ ] Open Pitchfork Protocol at http://localhost:8081
- [ ] Click "Connect Wallet" button in navigation
- [ ] Select MetaMask from wallet options
- [ ] Approve connection in MetaMask popup
- [ ] Verify wallet address appears in navigation
- [ ] Check network badge shows correct chain

### Phase 2: Identity Verification
- [ ] Navigate to Identity page (/identity)
- [ ] Verify wallet connection status
- [ ] Test basic verification process
- [ ] Check blockchain storage integration
- [ ] Verify progressive verification levels

### Phase 3: Governance Testing
- [ ] Navigate to Governance page (/governance)
- [ ] Create a new proposal
- [ ] Vote on existing proposals
- [ ] Check vote recording on blockchain
- [ ] Test proposal finalization

### Phase 4: Funding Campaigns
- [ ] Navigate to Support page (/support)
- [ ] Create a new funding campaign
- [ ] Make a contribution to campaign
- [ ] Check fund tracking and transparency
- [ ] Test fund withdrawal (creator only)

### Phase 5: Document Verification
- [ ] Navigate to Verify page (/verify)
- [ ] Upload a document
- [ ] Check IPFS storage integration
- [ ] Verify blockchain timestamp
- [ ] Test document retrieval

### Phase 6: Secure Messaging
- [ ] Navigate to Messages page (/messages)
- [ ] Test P2P connection setup
- [ ] Send encrypted messages
- [ ] Verify end-to-end encryption
- [ ] Check WebRTC functionality

## üîß Development Testing

### Local Blockchain Setup
```bash
# Install Hardhat for local blockchain
npm install --save-dev hardhat

# Start local blockchain
npx hardhat node

# Deploy contracts
node scripts/deploy-contracts.js
```

### Contract Interaction Testing
```javascript
// Test funding contract
const fundingContract = new ethers.Contract(
  FUNDING_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
  FUNDING_ABI,
  signer
);

// Create campaign
const tx = await fundingContract.createCampaign(
  "Test Campaign",
  "Testing blockchain integration",
  ethers.parseEther("1.0"), // 1 ETH goal
  30 // 30 days duration
);
```

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "No Web3 wallet detected"
**Solution**: Install MetaMask and refresh the page

### Issue: "Wrong network" warning
**Solution**: Switch MetaMask to supported network (Ethereum, Polygon, etc.)

### Issue: Transaction fails
**Solution**: 
- Check you have enough ETH for gas fees
- Verify contract addresses are correct
- Check network congestion

### Issue: IPFS upload fails
**Solution**: 
- Check IPFS node connection
- Verify file size limits
- Try again after network stabilizes

## üìä Expected Behavior

### Successful Wallet Connection
- Green "Connected" badge appears
- Wallet address shown (truncated)
- Network name displayed
- All Web3 features become available

### Successful Transaction
- MetaMask popup for transaction approval
- Transaction hash returned
- Blockchain confirmation
- UI updates with new state

### Successful IPFS Storage
- File uploaded to IPFS network
- Hash returned and stored on blockchain
- Document retrievable via hash
- Tamper-proof verification

## üîí Security Notes

### For Testing
- **NEVER** use mainnet with real funds for testing
- Use dedicated test wallets only
- Keep private keys secure
- Test on testnets first

### For Production
- Audit smart contracts before mainnet deployment
- Use hardware wallets for large amounts
- Implement multi-signature for critical functions
- Regular security assessments

## üìà Performance Metrics

### Expected Response Times
- Wallet connection: < 3 seconds
- Transaction submission: < 5 seconds
- Blockchain confirmation: 15-30 seconds (testnet)
- IPFS upload: < 10 seconds
- Document retrieval: < 5 seconds

### Gas Usage Estimates
- Create campaign: ~200,000 gas
- Vote on proposal: ~100,000 gas
- Contribute to campaign: ~80,000 gas
- Identity verification: ~150,000 gas

## üéØ Success Criteria

### Full Integration Success
- [ ] All wallet connections work smoothly
- [ ] Smart contracts deploy and function correctly
- [ ] IPFS storage and retrieval operational
- [ ] P2P messaging establishes connections
- [ ] All transactions confirm on blockchain
- [ ] UI updates reflect blockchain state
- [ ] Error handling works gracefully
- [ ] Performance meets expectations

## üöÄ Next Steps After Testing
